    <h1>IWM Texas Project - Opportunity Presentation with Unit Economics</h1>
    <p><strong>November 03, 2025</strong> | Comprehensive overview of dual-track opportunities (Pre-consumer waste for larvae, Post-consumer for frass) across Houston/Austin/Galveston/Valley regions. Unit economics added per section, including OPEX breakdowns (conservative estimates from Texas A&M/Flybox data: labor $15/hr, energy $0.08/kWh, transport $0.20/ton-mile).</p>

    <!-- Section 1: Mapping Feedstock Opportunities -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Mapping Feedstock Opportunities</h2>
        <div class="narrative">
            Imagine transforming the vast organic waste streams of Texas into a sustainable revenue engine, leveraging the unique strengths of the Houston/Austin/Galveston corridor. This region, rich with industrial food production, craft brewing, and coastal tourism, generates a staggering 2-3 million tons of organic waste annually. Our opportunity lies in tapping into pre-consumer sources like food culls and brewery mash, alongside post-consumer streams such as curbside organics and storm debris, to fuel a dual-track Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL) operation. With strategic placement along I-10 and I-45, and support from TCEQ exemptions and H-GAC subsidies, we can turn this waste into high-value products while addressing local environmental challenges. The dual streams ensure regulatory compliance and product quality, with pre-consumer feeding high-protein larvae markets and post-consumer yielding nutrient-rich frass for soil applications.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-Consumer (Larvae):</strong> High-potential sources include Sysco Houston with 90 tons/week of protein-rich culls (low contamination, ideal for 25% yield), Jester King Austin offering 50 tons/month of spent mash (high nitrogen for fast conversion), and Grand 1900 Galveston contributing 20 tons of seasonal seafood scraps (omega-3 boost for aquaculture resale). These streams minimize sorting costs and maximize larvae output.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Consumer (Frass):</strong> Opportunities abound with H-GAC Houston’s 230 tons/month of curbside organics (post-sorter at 4% contamination, suitable for 20% frass recovery), TDS Austin’s 50 tons of multifamily waste (urban food scraps for balanced NPK), and Galveston’s 30 tons of post-storm organics (yard/brush mix for volume spikes). These provide a robust, low-cost feedstock for frass, enhancing soil health across the region.</li>
            <li>Seasonal spikes and logistics are key, with hurricane-driven waste surges (up to 100 tons/week in Galveston) and potential hauler partnerships amplifying our reach. Initial target: 200-500 tons/month total, 60% pre for optimal yield.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="narrative">
            Picture a business model where economic viability hinges on outpacing traditional waste management methods, turning a cost center into a profit engine across Texas. With organic waste disposal costs soaring—landfill fees at $70-90/ton and composting at $40-60/ton—our BSFL approach offers a compelling alternative. By converting waste into larvae and frass, we not only reduce environmental impact but also unlock a financial edge, bolstered by tipping fees and subsidies, making this a standout opportunity in a market ripe for innovation. The dual-track model further optimizes economics, with pre-consumer streams driving higher-value larvae outputs and post-consumer enabling volume-driven frass sales, all while leveraging regional data for precise breakeven calculations.

            Envision a marketplace where every ton of waste becomes a tailored product, meeting the specific needs of Texas industries with precision and profitability. The opportunity here is to supply larvae from pre-consumer waste to thriving sectors like poultry and aquaculture, while positioning frass from post-consumer streams as a premium soil amendment for nurseries and shrimp farms. With demand outstripping local supply—especially in salty soil regions—this dual approach promises robust sales channels and a chance to lead a niche market with high growth potential. By securing off-take agreements and leveraging local logistics, we can achieve 70% local sales, minimizing costs and maximizing margins in a $100-150M US BSFL market slice.

            Consider a landscape where the frass market is ripe for disruption, particularly in Texas where salty soils pose a unique challenge that few address head-on. With a global frass market valued at $185 million in 2024 and projected to hit $1.12 billion by 2033, the U.S. portion—around $30-40 million—offers a fertile ground for growth. Locally, competition is fragmented with under 3,000 tons/year produced, leaving a gaping hole for a player to claim the salty soil niche with proven benefits like 24% root growth improvement, turning a regional weakness into our competitive edge. By focusing on post-consumer frass with TCEQ certification, we can undercut imports and retail players, capturing bulk B2B volume in nurseries and aquaculture.

            Imagine revitalizing Texas shrimp farms by tackling a silent killer: salinity buildup that threatens yields and inflates costs. Along the Gulf Coast, inland low-salinity ponds face EC levels of 8-12 dS/m, forcing expensive water exchanges ($20-50K/acre/year). Our opportunity lies in applying BSFL frass as a berm amendment, chelating sodium and stabilizing pH, as proven by Texas A&M trials showing an 8% harvest boost and 10-15% salt reduction. This niche solution positions us as a game-changer for farms like Danbury, turning post-consumer waste into a high-value soil buffer, with low regulatory hurdles and strong demand from the $500M Texas aquaculture sector.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Application Details:</strong> 1 ton/acre spread 6" deep on berm edges (earthen dikes)—not directly in water—to enhance soil buffering, promoting nitrifying bacteria (Nitrospira spp.) and reducing effective salt without chemical flushes.</li>
            <li><strong>Buyers & Demand:</strong> Danbury Farms (50 tons/yr for 100-acre ponds, $200-300/ton delivered), Bayou Blue Shrimp (20 tons/yr); total Gulf potential 500 tons/yr as farms expand inland.</li>
            <li><strong>Product Specs:</strong> Post-consumer frass (4-5-3 NPK, <0.2% sodium, pH 6.5-7.5); TCEQ soil permit only, no FDA issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Outreach Script:</strong> "Hi [Name], Our post-consumer frass cuts berm salinity 10-15% per A&M trials, boosting harvest 8%. Free 1-ton sample for your ponds?" Contact: Danbury GM, 979-885-XXXX.</li>

        <h2>9. Sample Outreach Emails</h2>
        <div class="narrative">
            Envision opening doors to key stakeholders with concise, compelling emails that spark interest and drive partnerships. These tailored messages target Sysco, Jester King, and Hatterman Poultry, offering free trials and samples to showcase the value of our BSFL solution. By leveraging local data and immediate cost savings, we can build trust and secure commitments, laying the foundation for a robust network of collaborators across Texas. Each email is designed to elicit quick responses, focusing on pain points like disposal costs and ESG goals, to accelerate pilot conversions.

Email 1: Sysco Houston (Pre-Consumer Pilot)
Subject: Free Pre-Consumer Waste Pickup - Save $28/Ton on Diversion
Body: Hi Javier, As a Houston-based BSFL processor, we turn unsellable produce into feed-grade larvae. Offer: Free pickup next week for one run (no cost, saves $28/ton vs. TDS hauling). If it works, lock a full contract. Reply yes for calendar invite. Best, [Your Name].

Email 2: Jester King (On-Site Mash Trial)
Subject: Free Spent Mash Trial - On-Site Module, Zero Cost to You
Body: Hey Adrienne, We're piloting Flybox modules for Austin breweries. Park a mini-unit on your lot for 2 weeks to process spent grains into larvae—no charge, no TDS fees. If yields hit 25% biomass, $32/ton ongoing (under compost rates). MOU attached. Thoughts? Link: [MOU Doc].

Email 3: Hatterman Poultry (Larvae Sample)
Subject: 5-Ton Larvae Sample from Local Houston Waste - Test Your Birds
Body: Ben, Sourcing Sysco culls for BSFL larvae (65% protein, path-free). Offer: 5-ton sample next month, AGT lab certs covered. Compare to soy—no flavor change, half carbon footprint. Call to schedule? [Your Phone].
