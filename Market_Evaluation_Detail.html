    <h1>IWM Texas Project - Opportunity Presentation with Unit Economics</h1>
    <p><strong>November 03, 2025</strong> | Comprehensive overview of dual-track opportunities (Pre-consumer waste for larvae, Post-consumer for frass) across Houston/Austin/Galveston/Valley regions. Unit economics added per section, including OPEX breakdowns (conservative estimates from Texas A&M/Flybox data: labor $15/hr, energy $0.08/kWh, transport $0.20/ton-mile).</p>

    <!-- Section 1: Mapping Feedstock Opportunities -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Mapping Feedstock Opportunities</h2>
        <div class="narrative">
            Imagine transforming the vast organic waste streams of Texas into a sustainable revenue engine, leveraging the unique strengths of the Houston/Austin/Galveston corridor. This region, rich with industrial food production, craft brewing, and coastal tourism, generates a staggering 2-3 million tons of organic waste annually. Our opportunity lies in tapping into pre-consumer sources like food culls and brewery mash, alongside post-consumer streams such as curbside organics and storm debris, to fuel a dual-track Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL) operation. With strategic placement along I-10 and I-45, and support from TCEQ exemptions and H-GAC subsidies, we can turn this waste into high-value products while addressing local environmental challenges. The dual streams ensure regulatory compliance and product quality, with pre-consumer feeding high-protein larvae markets and post-consumer yielding nutrient-rich frass for soil applications.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-Consumer (Larvae):</strong> High-potential sources include Sysco Houston with 90 tons/week of protein-rich culls (low contamination, ideal for 25% yield), Jester King Austin offering 50 tons/month of spent mash (high nitrogen for fast conversion), and Grand 1900 Galveston contributing 20 tons of seasonal seafood scraps (omega-3 boost for aquaculture resale). These streams minimize sorting costs and maximize larvae output.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Consumer (Frass):</strong> Opportunities abound with H-GAC Houston’s 230 tons/month of curbside organics (post-sorter at 4% contamination, suitable for 20% frass recovery), TDS Austin’s 50 tons of multifamily waste (urban food scraps for balanced NPK), and Galveston’s 30 tons of post-storm organics (yard/brush mix for volume spikes). These provide a robust, low-cost feedstock for frass, enhancing soil health across the region.</li>
            <li>Seasonal spikes and logistics are key, with hurricane-driven waste surges (up to 100 tons/week in Galveston) and potential hauler partnerships amplifying our reach. Initial target: 200-500 tons/month total, 60% pre for optimal yield.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="narrative">
            Picture a business model where economic viability hinges on outpacing traditional waste management methods, turning a cost center into a profit engine across Texas. With organic waste disposal costs soaring—landfill fees at $70-90/ton and composting at $40-60/ton—our BSFL approach offers a compelling alternative. By converting waste into larvae and frass, we not only reduce environmental impact but also unlock a financial edge, bolstered by tipping fees and subsidies, making this a standout opportunity in a market ripe for innovation. The dual-track model further optimizes economics, with pre-consumer streams driving higher-value larvae outputs and post-consumer enabling volume-driven frass sales, all while leveraging regional data for precise breakeven calculations.

            Envision a marketplace where every ton of waste becomes a tailored product, meeting the specific needs of Texas industries with precision and profitability. The opportunity here is to supply larvae from pre-consumer waste to thriving sectors like poultry and aquaculture, while positioning frass from post-consumer streams as a premium soil amendment for nurseries and shrimp farms. With demand outstripping local supply—especially in salty soil regions—this dual approach promises robust sales channels and a chance to lead a niche market with high growth potential. By securing off-take agreements and leveraging local logistics, we can achieve 70% local sales, minimizing costs and maximizing margins in a $100-150M US BSFL market slice.

            Consider a landscape where the frass market is ripe for disruption, particularly in Texas where salty soils pose a unique challenge that few address head-on. With a global frass market valued at $185 million in 2024 and projected to hit $1.12 billion by 2033, the U.S. portion—around $30-40 million—offers a fertile ground for growth. Locally, competition is fragmented with under 3,000 tons/year produced, leaving a gaping hole for a player to claim the salty soil niche with proven benefits like 24% root growth improvement, turning a regional weakness into our competitive edge. By focusing on post-consumer frass with TCEQ certification, we can undercut imports and retail players, capturing bulk B2B volume in nurseries and aquaculture.

            Imagine revitalizing Texas shrimp farms by tackling a silent killer: salinity buildup that threatens yields and inflates costs. Along the Gulf Coast, inland low-salinity ponds face EC levels of 8-12 dS/m, forcing expensive water exchanges ($20-50K/acre/year). Our opportunity lies in applying BSFL frass as a berm amendment, chelating sodium and stabilizing pH, as proven by Texas A&M trials showing an 8% harvest boost and 10-15% salt reduction. This niche solution positions us as a game-changer for farms like Danbury, turning post-consumer waste into a high-value soil buffer, with low regulatory hurdles and strong demand from the $500M Texas aquaculture sector.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Application Details:</strong> 1 ton/acre spread 6" deep on berm edges (earthen dikes)—not directly in water—to enhance soil buffering, promoting nitrifying bacteria (Nitrospira spp.) and reducing effective salt without chemical flushes.</li>
            <li><strong>Buyers & Demand:</strong> Danbury Farms (50 tons/yr for 100-acre ponds, $200-300/ton delivered), Bayou Blue Shrimp (20 tons/yr); total Gulf potential 500 tons/yr as farms expand inland.</li>
            <li><strong>Product Specs:</strong> Post-consumer frass (4-5-3 NPK, <0.2% sodium, pH 6.5-7.5); TCEQ soil permit only, no FDA issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Outreach Script:</strong> "Hi [Name], Our post-consumer frass cuts berm salinity 10-15% per A&M trials, boosting harvest 8%. Free 1-ton sample for your ponds?" Contact: Danbury GM, 979-885-XXXX.</li>
